# Theoretical Computer Science

Here you'll find learning resources on the fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science.

All of these resources are based on an introductory course taught by [Javier Esparza](https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/) at TUM in the summer term of 2021.

_I'll continuously update and extend these resources as the course progresses._
