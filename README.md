# Theoretical Computer Science

Here you'll find learning resources on the fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science.

All of these resources are based on an introductory course taught by [Javier Esparza](https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/) at TUM in the summer term of 2021.

_I'll continuously update and extend these resources as the course progresses._

### Material

1. Languages and Grammars. [Handout](https://jonhue.github.io/teaching-theo/handout-languages_and_grammars.pdf). [Slides](https://jonhue.github.io/teaching-dwt-rev/languages_and_grammars.pdf).
2. Regular Languages. [Handout](https://jonhue.github.io/teaching-theo/handout-regular_languages.pdf). [Slides](https://jonhue.github.io/teaching-dwt-rev/regular_languages.pdf).
3. Decidability and Computability (in progress). [Handout](https://jonhue.github.io/teaching-theo/handout-decidability_and_computability.pdf). [Slides](https://jonhue.github.io/teaching-dwt-rev/decidability_and_computability.pdf).
